Below is a ranked list from most likely to least likely to become a mass-scale YouTube success (millions of views, consistent $1k–$10k+/month).
Ranking is based on historical YouTube performance patterns, retention mechanics, shareability, algorithm friendliness, and your ability to execute at scale with automation.

1. Creepiest Things That Happened to Normal People
(Your #4)

Why this wins

Proven evergreen genre (AskReddit, MrBallen-adjacent, TikTok creepypasta)

“This really happened” creates immediate curiosity + belief tension

Extremely strong hook density

Works exceptionally well in Shorts and long-form

Algorithm strengths

High swipe-stop

Strong comments (“this happened to me”)

Excellent rewatch/share behavior

Risk

Must avoid obvious fiction tone

Requires steady sourcing or believable synthesis

Verdict:
Highest probability of multi-million view videos.
This is your safest bet for scale.

2. Disturbing Facts Explained as Stories
(Your #2)

Why it works

Combines education + discomfort (very high retention)

One-idea focus prevents fatigue

Already validated across Shorts and TikTok

Algorithm strengths

Strong watch-through due to “I didn’t know this”

High save rate

Less saturation than list-based facts

Risk

Needs disciplined writing to avoid drifting into “fact list energy”

Tone must stay grounded, not sensational

Verdict:
Extremely strong, slightly less viral than #1 but more durable long-term.

3. Impossible Scenarios (Non-Horror)
(Your #1)

Why it works

Infinite idea surface

Zero sourcing risk

Perfect for automation

Clean, advertiser-friendly

Algorithm strengths

Excellent curiosity hooks

Strong retention if consequences escalate properly

Very scalable

Why it’s not #1

Less emotional than fear-based content

Virality depends heavily on writing quality

Fewer “share because it shocked me” moments

Verdict:
High ceiling, slightly lower hit rate per video.
Best non-horror flagship channel.

4. True Near-Miss Disasters
(Your #3)

Why it works

Real-world stakes = strong tension

Thriller framing is effective

High credibility appeal

Why it’s lower

Narrower audience

Requires factual accuracy (slows scale)

Less rewatchable than psychology/horror

Algorithm strengths

Strong mid-video retention

Good long-form performance

Decent Shorts performance

Verdict:
Solid channel, fewer viral spikes but good consistency.

5. Psychological Experiments That Went Wrong
(Your #5)

Why it works

Human behavior always performs

Strong moral/emotional angle

Why it struggles

Oversaturated topic

Familiar experiments reduce novelty

Easy to drift into documentary pacing

Algorithm reality

Performs well with strong editing

Harder to stand out without a unique framing rule

Verdict:
Good secondary channel, not a breakout machine.

6. Strange Rules People Didn’t Know They Were Following
(Your #6)

Why it’s interesting

Relatable

Easy to produce

Clean visuals

Why it underperforms

Low emotional intensity

Often feels “obvious” halfway through

Lower share impulse

Algorithm reality

Fine for steady views

Rarely explodes unless phrasing is exceptional

Verdict:
Reliable but unlikely to produce massive spikes.

7. Long-Form Horror / Thriller Stories (Companion Channel)
(Your #7)

Why it’s last

Long-form horror is crowded

Slower growth

Monetization lag

Why you should still do it

Shorts funnel strategy is smart

High RPM potential over time

Excellent brand depth

Verdict:
Strategically smart, but not a fast path to millions.

Final Ranking (Most → Least Likely to Hit Massive Scale)
Creepiest Things That Happened to Normal People

Disturbing Facts Explained as Stories

Impossible Scenarios (Non-Horror)

True Near-Miss Disasters

Psychological Experiments That Went Wrong

Strange Rules People Didn’t Know They Were Following

Long-Form Horror / Thriller Stories

Blunt Strategic Take
If your goal is money + speed + scale:

Launch #1 and #2 first

Use #3 as your clean, advertiser-safe backbone

Treat #7 as a slow-burn asset, not a growth engine

If you want, next step I can:

Assign expected view ranges per video

Map RPM expectations

Or tell you which two to launch first and why
