    """
This happened during spring break of my junior year of college. Me and my three closest friends, Kevin, Ally, and Seb, decided to go car camping in Colorado. We'd been doing these trips together since freshman year, but we were all pretty broke that semester, so we went with dispersed camping instead of paying for an actual campground. I found this spot on one of those camping apps that showed free sights. It was somewhere outside of Buenav Vista, tucked back on this forest service road that seemed to go on forever. The four of us had done enough camping together that we knew what we were doing. We got there around late afternoon and found this clearing near what looked like it used to be a creek bed. It was completely dried up, but you could tell water had run through there at some point. The area was pretty isolated. We didn't see any other campers or even tire tracks from recent visitors. It was honestly perfect for the kind of vibe we were going for. We set up our tents in a loose cluster, maybe 15 ft apart from each other. Nothing fancy about the arrangement. Just wherever the ground looked level and didn't have too many rocks. I don't even remember what we did that night. Probably just drank a few of the beers we brought while playing cards. We were all pretty tired from the drive, so we called it around 11:00 and went to our separate tents. I remember sleeping really heavily that night, which was weird for me to begin with, but especially during a camping trip usually. And this is when I'm sleeping on a comfortable bed in a climate controlled room. I wake up multiple times from being cold or needing to pee or whatever else. Point is, I'm a very light sleeper. And during a camping trip, forget it. I'm used to waking up at least three times. But that night, I felt completely knocked out, like I'd taken a sleeping pill or something. When I woke up the next morning, something felt off immediately. I unzipped my tent to get some fresh air. And then I just froze. I noticed it immediately. All four of our tents had been moved, like not ruffled or roughed up by an animal. Actually moved. They were arranged in this perfect square formation around a pile of stones that definitely hadn't been there when we went to sleep. Part of me felt like I was still dreaming. That's how bizarre and borderline unbelievable the site before me was. Each tent had been relocated maybe 20 or 30 ft from where we'd originally set them up, but that's not really what freaked me out. The stakes were still perfectly secured in the ground, and nothing inside any of the tents had been disturbed. My sleeping bag was exactly how I left it. My phone was still plugged into my portable charger, and all my other gear was in the same spot. Nothing was missing from my tent, which I checked, double checked, and triple checked. I thought I was going crazy. I yelled to wake up my friends. Kevin was the first one to emerge from his tent, and I didn't even have to explain the situation to him. I could see on his face that he was experiencing the same confusion I was. Ally and Seb crawled out a few seconds later, and as I watched them take a look around at the campsite, it was the exact same thing. None of us remembered anything. But then Ally mentioned that she'd had this really vivid dream about walking in a lion through some kind of desert landscape while someone counted her steps out loud. And then Kevin chimed in saying he had a dream about being in the army marching alongside his fellow soldiers. Seb didn't remember having a dream and neither did I, but we found it odd that both Ally and Kevin had eerily similar dreams. The vibe between the four of us was really weird but hard to describe. It was almost like we were reading each other's minds. It's kind of hard to express the feeling, but it really did feel like we were more connected than we had been the night before, but in a bad way. I remember looking back and forth between them, trying to figure out what it was that I was feeling around me. The best way I can think to describe the feeling is what it would have felt like if there was a fifth person watching all of us who was also part of all of us. We examined the campsite a little more carefully, looking for clues or anything that would help us piece together what happened. At first, Kevin suggested that maybe we had just gotten really drunk and forgot about what we did the night before. But this theory was shattered in about 5 seconds. We found these drag marks in the dirt leading from where each tent had originally been positioned to where they ended up. The weird thing was the drag marks stopped about 10 ft short of each tent's final location, like someone had dragged them partway and then lifted and carried them the rest of the distance. The pile of stones in the center was even stranger. There were exactly four stones, and they were balanced on top of each other like some kind of sculpture. It actually would have been pretty were it not for the circumstances. Kevin walked over to get a closer look and as he was leaning in to examine the top stone, he tripped and ended up knocking the whole thing over. The stones just kind of tumbled to the ground. Nothing dramatic. For a second, the four of us just stood there in silence, staring at the scattered stones. And then things went from a five to a 10. At the exact same time, all four of us started hearing this low rumbling sound coming from somewhere in the distance. It sounded like rocks grinding against each other. Not like an earthquake or anything, more like an old stone door being pushed open. Hearing that sound kind of sent us into a panic, and we all just started packing without even discussing things. Like I said before, it felt like we were reading each other's minds. And that also applied to our feelings. I could feel my friend's fear, and I knew they could feel mine. It was really freaky. 10 times freakier than it had been not 2 minutes ago. I don't think I've ever packed up a campsite so quickly in my life. Realistically, we were out of there in under 5 minutes, but it felt like an eternity in that moment. I'm not going to harp too much on what happened. I really don't like thinking about what happened that night, and I'm worried that if I think too much about it, it'll go from being a fever dream that sort of sits in the back of my mind to something more real. That was 5 years ago. Now, the four of us don't really see each other anymore, but I guess that's kind of how it goes as everyone gets older. Kevin moved to Denver after graduation. Alli's in grad school in California, and I think Seb moved to Chicago with his girlfriend. We keep in touch, but we've never really talked about that night since.

My name is Simon. This happened last summer when I was 23. My girlfriend Cadence and I had been planning this camping trip for months. Just the two of us. No cell service, no distractions. We'd been together for about a year and a half at that point. And honestly, things had been getting a little stale. Not bad, just routine. We figured a weekend in the woods would be good for us. We picked a spot in the URI National Forest in North Carolina. I'd been looking at different locations online for weeks, trying to find something that wasn't too crowded, but also wasn't completely isolated. The place I settled on was this campground about 3 mi down a forest service road. According to the reviews, it had maybe six or seven sites total, and they were pretty spread out from each other. We left Friday afternoon around 3:00, stopped for supplies at a grocery store near the forest entrance, and made it to the campground just before sunset. The road getting there was rough, lots of potholes and loose gravel, but my truck handled it fine. When we pulled into the main clearing, I was honestly pretty satisfied with my choice. There were a few picnic tables scattered around, a couple fire rings, and the sights themselves were tucked back into the trees enough that you'd have some privacy. We drove around slowly, checking out the different spots. Most of them were empty, which was good. We passed one site that had a blue sedan parked there, but I couldn't see anyone around it. Cadence pointed to a spot at the far end of the campground, right where the road deadended into the forest. It had a decent clearing for the tent and was positioned so that the trees blocked the view of the other campsites. We spent the next hour setting everything up. Cadence is one of those people who's really particular about how things are arranged, so I mostly just followed her instructions. By the time we were done, it was starting to get dark. I got a fire going while Cadence made sandwiches, and for a while, everything felt exactly how it was supposed to. We were sitting there drinking beer, watching the flames, not really talking about anything important, just existing together, which I think was kind of the point. Around 10 or so, Cadence went to brush her teeth at the spigot near the picnic tables. I stayed by the fire, poking at it with a stick and finishing my beer. That's when I noticed someone standing at the edge of our site, just beyond where the light of the fire reached. I jumped a little, I'm not going to lie, because I genuinely hadn't heard anyone walk up. The guy apologized for startling me and said he was camped over in the blue sedan and that he just wanted to introduce himself. His name was Aiden, and he looked to be about 30. He had this really intense way of maintaining eye contact that made me a little uncomfortable, but I obviously wasn't going to say anything. Cadence walked back toward us, and I could tell from the way her hips were swaying that she was not pleased with the interruption. Aiden noticed her, turned, and said she'd picked a good spot. Real secluded. He mentioned he was solo camping, trying to get away from people for the weekend, which seemed kind of contradictory since he was literally standing at our campsite making conversation. And by the way, as soon as Cadence walked back, I didn't exist anymore. This guy Aiden's full attention was on my girlfriend, which wasn't exactly surprising, but weird as hell. We talked for another minute or two. And by we, I mean he talked at Cadence while she just gave him awkward reply after awkward reply, waiting for him to get to him. Eventually, I buted in and told him we wanted to get some sleep because we were waking up early, and that got him to leave. As soon as we walked into the darkness, I noticed he didn't use a flashlight or anything, which I thought was a little odd. Cadence and I agreed about the weirdness of the whole thing and decided to try and forget about it. We stayed up for another hour or so, then put out the fire and went to bed. I don't remember falling asleep, but I do remember waking up, and the moment I woke up, I realized something was wrong. It took me all of 3 seconds to realize I had woken up to voices somewhere in the distance. It sounded like two people having a conversation somewhere near our campsite. I looked over and saw Cadence fast asleep, and that's when the guardian instinct in me kicked in. I didn't freeze or cower in the tent, but rather actually went out to investigate. I unzipped the tent as quietly as I could and poked my head out. The voices stopped almost immediately, like they had heard me, even though I thought I was being dead silent. As quickly as I could, I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight, shining it around our campsite. But whoever had been there had either already left or was further away than I initially thought. Eventually, I went back inside the tent and tried to go back to sleep. It was a public campsite after all. People stay up really late on camping trips, so I didn't think it was anything threatening. I just hoped whoever had been out there got the hint to have their 3:00 a.m. talk somewhere far away from where I was trying to sleep. I didn't bother mentioning it to Cadence the next morning. I didn't really see the point in stressing her out over nothing. We spent most of the day hiking, which was a lot of fun and a decent workout, honestly. As the sun started to go down, I went to grab more firewood from a pile we'd made near the truck. That's when I noticed something on the windshield. It was a napkin folded in half and tucked under the wiper blade. I pulled it out and unfolded it, and I was shocked to discover that it was a note. a note saying, "You should move your tent." I obviously wasn't going to keep that to myself, so I showed Cadence the note and told her what happened the night before. When she saw the note, she immediately asked if it was Aiden, I said, "I guess so, because who else would it be?" And as the two of us were discussing what to do next, obviously more than a little freaked out, as if on Q, who walks up but Aiden. He was wearing the exact same get up as the day before and looking at him filled me with a mix of rage and fear. The rage won and I told him he needed to stop just walking up like that more aggressively than I probably should have. I was 100% convinced he was behind the note and the talking for the night before and I wasn't going to let him think that he was fooling me. He said sorry in a gruff voice and said he was just checking up on us. Before I could respond, Cadence asked him why he'd need to check up on us and actually said something that really surprised me. He told us he didn't want to freak us out, but that he was surprised to see people as young as we were at the campsite. He said that there was a bunch of weird stuff that had been known to occur around here. Freaky stuff. He said he'd found deserted campsites deep in the woods, signs of people, belongings, and other weird things. I didn't really trust a word he was saying, but he said it so matterof factly that part of me thought he was being genuine. He went on to say that he heard people walking around his car the night before, so he was going to cut his trip short and go home before the sunset. Then he advised us to do the same. At that point, I wasn't going to argue, and it's not like Cadence wanted to stick around, either. So, we all started packing our stuff. It was pretty stressful being as the sun was already almost set to begin with. I could tell Cadence was starting to freak out because her hands were shaking as she was putting stuff in the car and I tried my best to calm her down, but I wasn't feeling great about things either. We finally finished getting everything in the car and I started pulling out without another word. The sun was basically set at that point and it would probably be fully dark in a few minutes. But as I was driving out, I noticed Aiden's blue sedan was still in his campsite, which I found strange. I saw Aiden crouched down near one of his tires. So, I actually stopped my car. I asked him what he was doing and he stepped back from his car to reveal massive gash in the tire. Something that was definitely done deliberately. There was no question about it. Cadence said, "Holy," and I was pretty shocked to see it as well. I didn't know what to do. At first, he asked if I could give him a lift, but Cadence whispered that she wouldn't be comfortable with that. So, I told him I couldn't, which led him to ask me if I would call the police for him as soon as I got service. And I told him I would. I pulled out of the campground and started down the dirt road. My headlights were on full blast. We were maybe 100 yards down the road when I glanced to my right and saw them. There were three figures standing in the woods, maybe 30 ft off the road. They weren't moving, and it didn't look like they were trying to hide either, almost like they wanted to be seen. I only saw them for a split second, but I was 100% sure they were people. And Cadence noticed them as well. My foot instinctively hit the brake. I don't even know why. Maybe some part of me thought I should go back and warn Aiden. Or maybe I was just trying to process what I was seeing. But before I could think it through, Cadence grabbed my arm and screamed at me to drive, like a genuine scream. So, I did. Cadence didn't say anything the entire way back to the main highway. As soon as I got service, I pulled over and called 911. I told them everything, and the dispatcher said they'd sent someone to check on him. We never heard back from them. I wasn't really expecting to, but I had this sick feeling that something really wrong happened to Aiden and that I was partly to blame. Cadence tried to reassure me that he was in on the whole thing, which is a possibility, but I think that's just a way to cope more than anything. Either way, this is still something I think about from time to time.

This was 2 days ago. I was 28 at the time, working remotely as an IT consultant out of Bosezeman. The job wasn't anything special, but it paid okay, and being able to work from anywhere in the world was a huge plus for me. Unfortunately, I was going through kind of a rough patch at the time. I had just gotten divorced about 3 months earlier and I wasn't handling it well. Nothing I tried was working and believe me, I tried everything. It seems a little foolish and naive looking back, but at one point I was convinced I'd spend the rest of my life in misery unless I did something drastic like go off the grid and spend a few weeks in the wilderness type drastic. So that's kind of what I did. Camping has always been a big part of my life, so trekking out in the wilderness all alone isn't actually as crazy as it sounds, at least for me. I'm actually a lifelong scout. Couldn't make Eagle quite in time. But the point is, I know my way around wilderness better than most. I've got my old man to thank for that. I didn't want to go anywhere where there'd be other people around, though. That would have defeated the whole point. I needed to be alone alone. So, I did what any reasonable person does at 2 a.m. when they can't sleep. I went down the internet rabbit hole. Eventually, I found this old Montana backcountry camping forum that had a bunch of posts about some unofficial sites in the Helena Lewis and Clark National Forest. So, right then and there, I made the decision. The next morning, I planned everything out. The only person I told where I was going was my brother, and I didn't even mention the specific spot to him, just a vague description of the general area. I had a bunch of PTO saved up, so missing a week or so of work wasn't the end of the world. If I'm remembering correctly, that was a Tuesday, so it must have been a Thursday by the time I had my truck fully loaded up. I had enough supplies to last me the full week and then some. freeze-dried meals, water purification tablets, a first aid kit, and all the other essentials. And of course, my Remington 700. I'm not a gun nut or anything, but you don't go that deep into the Montana wilderness without protection from wildlife. The drive out there was about 4 hours from Boseman. First three and a half were easy. Highway to county road, county road to forest service road. That last bit though, what a headache. My GPS kept trying to reroute me because the service road I needed wasn't in its system. After some painful backtracking and double-checking the descriptions of some of those online posts, I found this overgrown trail that seemed to match up with what someone had written. Twice I had to stop to move branches and other debris that were blocking the path. My truck's a decent 4x4, but I was starting to worry about getting stuck. I drove along the path until it was impossible to go any further, at which point I just shut my engine. I knew I'd have to reverse out of there when the time came to leave, but I had been prepared for that, so I wasn't too concerned. As soon as I stepped out of my truck, I was pretty confident I was in the right spot. But that far into the wilderness, there's not really a right spot since everything's as remote as everything else. Either way, I was pleased. There was a clearing not too far from the cluster of trees I had parked in front of, and it looked like a perfect place to set up camp, except there was already a tent there. I noticed it almost immediately. It was this old olive green tent that looked like it was from the8s. My first thought was that someone else had found those coordinates, but the tent looked like it had been there for years. There was actual mold growing on the ceilings, like visible from 20 ft away kind of mold. I walked over out of curiosity. I probably shouldn't have, but whatever. I called out a friendly hello and waited. There was no response. The zipper was partly open, so I just unzipped it the rest of the way. And let me tell you, the smell in there was god awful. It smelled like something had died inside. The stench was unbearable. But I was in too deep and was too curious to just walk away. I looked around the tent and saw an empty sleeping bag, some soup cans, and a little notebook. I withtood the nastiness just long enough to grab the notebook and reach my head back into the pure air. There wasn't anything else in the tent besides what I already mentioned, so I didn't see the need to keep investigating, but something was making that smell, which I didn't really understand. But anyway, after stepping out of the tent, I started flipping through this little notebook and immediately realized what it is. pages and pages of tally marks. There must have been hundreds of them in there, all in groups of seven. The last page had 42 groups, which is over 8 months. I wasn't really spooked at that point, more so curious and kind of excited to have stumbled upon my own little mystery. But after flipping through the notebook a few times, there wasn't really much else to do. I ended up keeping it. What was I going to do? Return it? But anyway, I decided to set up my own camp on the opposite side of the clearing, a decent distance away from the tent, but close enough to keep an eye on it. I didn't like the thought of letting it out of my line of sight. As I settled into the spot and acclimated myself with my surroundings, I realized there were no signs that anyone had actually camped here before. I went for a pretty extensive hike and didn't find any old fire rings, trash, trails, footprints, anything that would even marginally suggest another human. It was a really clear night that night. I remember that distinctly because the stars were incredible out there. The drive and setup had exhausted me, so I fell asleep pretty quickly. I woke up randomly in the middle of the night. I had no idea what time it was, but I knew for a fact I didn't wake up to nothing. I'm a very heavy sleeper, even out in the wilderness, so I knew something was wrong. I froze in the dark and listened, trying to hear for an animal or whatever else could have woken me up. And after about 30 seconds, I heard it. Whispers. It sounded like two or three different voices. And if I had to guess, I'd say they were maybe 20 ft from my tent. They were having some kind of conversation, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. I was so freaked out I started sweating. When you go that deep in the wilderness to be alone, the last thing you're expecting to stumble upon is another person, let alone multiple people. It doesn't sound like the scariest thing, per se, but in the moment, I was terrified. I stayed frozen in my sleeping bag, pretending to be asleep. The voices stopped, but I still didn't want to move. And after a few seconds, I started hearing footsteps around my tent. I realized whoever was out there was circling my tent the way an animal might. Instinctively, my hand went straight to my rifle, which turned out to be the correct decision because not 2 seconds later, someone started yanking on my tent zipper. When it didn't budge, thanks to the clips I'd put on, they pulled back. I had my rifle aimed directly at the tent flap, and a very strong part of me wanted to just fire right then. I was expecting the person messing with my tent to just leave, but no. They started scratching the flap like they were trying to cut their way in, and that's what sent me over the edge. I spoke up, saying I had a gun and to back the [ __ ] off. The scratching stopped immediately. There were a few seconds of complete silence, and then I heard footsteps, multiple sets of footsteps running away in what sounded like different directions. It sounded like at least three people, which was somehow 10 times worse than the thought of it being just two. They didn't all run the same way, which struck me as strange. I didn't sleep much that night, but I felt very safe with my rifle by my side. As soon as the sun rose, I unzipped my tent and stepped outside, making a big show of brandishing my rifle. I immediately looked over at where the old moldy tent had been. It was gone. I walked over to the spot where I knew it had been. There was no ground depression, no stake holes, nothing. The grass wasn't even flattened, but I knew for a fact there had been a tent there. I had stared at it for hours the previous day. What I did find were footprints, bare human footprints, all around my campsite in a rough circle about 20 ft out. There were tons of them and they were different sizes which confirmed to me that there had been more than just two people out there. Some of them were also really deep like whoever made them had been standing there for a long time. One set of prints led over to a big pine tree at the edge of the clearing. I walked over and that's when I saw them. Fresh cuts in the bark. I knew what they were. Tally marks. Seven groups of seven and the start of an eighth group. Just like the notebook, I just kind of stood there trying to make sense of it. The notebook had been counting something for over 8 months. And now there were fresh marks on this tree right next to my campsite. I didn't want to think about what that meant. It gets much, much worse, though, because as I was backing away from the tree, I noticed something else. It was and still is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen. There was a dead squirrel hanging from a low branch a few feet away, tied up with what looked like a fishing line. I'm not squeamish about dead animals. I'm a hunter for Christ's sake. But something about the way it was positioned made me want to puke. I didn't really need any more of an indication. I immediately ran back to my campsite and started packing my stuff as fast as I could. I'll admit that my hands were actually shaking while I took down my sight, and I was having trouble focusing on the task at hand without looking over my shoulder every few seconds. After what felt like forever, I finally finished packing everything and started jogging towards my truck. I threw everything in, jumped in the truck, and started backing out. Part of me thought my tires were going to be slashed or something else, but thankfully my truck was untouched. The path was narrow and backing out was even harder than pulling in. So, the ordeal was torture. It was hell, but I made it. And I don't think I was followed. By the time I made it back home, I decided I wouldn't even bother calling anyone. I did not think there was a point. Like, realistically, what would I even report? It's not like anyone would go that far into the woods to investigate. The thing that freaks me out the most is the sight of that squirrel. No one does that unless they're trying to send a message or a threat. I honestly don't know what would have happened if I stayed another night or if I hadn't been armed.

This happened many years ago. I've never liked camping. I'm just not built for it. The dirt, the bugs, the uncomfortable nights in a sleeping bag that somehow always end up feeling like a rock by morning. Unfortunately, I've been camping more times than I can count, though never by choice. My dad is one of those rugged, wilderness loving types. And every summer when I was a kid, he dragged me out into the woods with his equally rugged friends to disconnect from technology and reconnect with nature. By the time I hit sophomore year of high school, I'd had enough of suffering in silence. I finally convinced him to let me bring a friend along to make the whole thing a little more bearable. To my surprise, he agreed without much fuss. So, I brought my friend Charles from school. Now, you'd think bringing Charles would have made it worse, considering he was a hardcore boy scout back in the day and actually loves camping, but Charles was cool about it. He teased me for hating it, but he wasn't one of those you're not a real man if you don't love the outdoors types. Plus, I figured if I had to suffer, at least I'd be suffering with someone who knew how to make a fire and pitch a tent without turning it into a full-blown disaster. He was stoked to come, partly because he loves camping, but also because back then he looked for any excuse to get away from his parents. Unfortunately, the trip didn't go as planned from the start. It turned out that one of my dad's friends had messed up the campsite booking. Instead of some remote, peaceful spot deep in the woods, we ended up at this crappy, overdeveloped campsite. I'm talking indoor bathrooms, paved walkways, and even a playground for little kids. It wasn't camping. It was basically glorified backyard living or glamping, I guess. To say my dad was upset would be an understatement. We didn't even discover the worst part until a few hours later. Right next to the campsite was a mini amusement park. I'm not joking. An actual amusement park with carnival games, a ferris wheel, and a handful of roller coasters. It's surreal. Those two settings were never supposed to collide. an amusement park and a campsite. Everyone was pissed. My dad and his friend grumbled about how this wasn't real camping, and Charles wouldn't shut up about it either. "This isn't real camping," he kept saying, as if I needed the reminder. "It started getting annoying because Charles kept making jokes about my family as if we didn't know what real camping was." "Now, as much as I hate camping, I know what it's supposed to look like. So, I was getting annoyed that Charles was suggesting otherwise. I told him to knock it off and he did. The whole situation sucked. We had driven hours out to the site. It wasn't like we could just turn around and leave. So, with no better option, we made the best of it. The grown-ups sulked for a bit, but eventually got to work setting up the camp. And Charles, of course, stepped up like it was time to shine. Within minutes, we had our tent up, all the knots tied perfectly, the rainfly secure, the whole thing staked and touted like it came out of a manual. Even my dad, who never really gave compliments unless someone was bleeding or unconscious, nodded in approval, which got under my skin a bit. Charles and I were sharing a tent, and once everything was set up and dinner was done, we slipped away for a bit under the excuse of organizing our stuff. The truth was Charles had brought a little metal pipe and some weed in an old Altoids tin. Nothing crazy, just enough to take the edge off. I should mention that Charles and I were in that delinquent phase of life where we liked causing trouble and hanging around in places we didn't belong. I don't smoke weed anymore, and part of me will always wonder if the only reason I ever did was because I was trying to stick out and defy the norm. Anyway, the two of us snuck into the woods and smoked, chuckling to ourselves the entire time. I don't think either of us were worried about smelling since we'd probably be avoiding the adults for the rest of the night. We finished our session and made our way back to the tent. After a few hours of just chilling and talking about some of our other friends from school, we both agreed that we had way too much energy to sleep. Charles had a very mischievous grin on his face, and I could only imagine what he was thinking. He suggested we go explore the campsite and I was skeptical. That is until I realized he meant explore the amusement park, which instantly piqued my interest. He said it would probably be a piece of cake getting to the top of one of those roller coasters. Climbing stuff was something we loved doing back then, and the thought of climbing a roller coaster was exhilarating. So, after we were sure everyone was asleep, we made our move. It was really late by then, well after midnight. We grabbed our flashlights and headed to the fence surrounding the park. It wasn't even that hard to climb. Just a little boost from Charles and we were in. The place was dark, but there were security guards patrolling. And every so often, we'd hear the hum of a golf cart making its rounds. It felt like we were in some kind of stealth video game, sneaking around and trying not to get caught. We progressed through the park slowly, ducking behind buildings and keeping an eye on the patrol. At one point, we had to sprint across an open stretch of road to avoid a guard. It was actually really thrilling, but also scary as hell. It's a hard feeling to describe. Everything seemed like a game, but both of us knew the consequences would be harsh if we were caught. We finally made it to the base of the roller coaster, and from up close, it looked way bigger than it had from the campsite. We spotted the maintenance stairs running up alongside the main ascent and didn't hesitate. The metal rungs clang softly under our feet as we climbed one step at a time, trying not to make too much noise. There were no railings for part of the stretch, which was actually kind of terrifying. We finally reached the top and the view was unreal. We could see the entire park below us. We took a single photo up there, as you can see here. I wish we had taken more pictures, but we were being extremely cautious as to not draw attention to ourselves as we wouldn't be able to get away in time if someone spotted us from below. Eventually, we figured we'd pushed our luck long enough and decided to head back. After making it to the bottom, we started creeping through the park back the way we had come. For whatever reason, the return route was much quicker than the initial one. Maybe the patrol wasn't as intense or something at that hour. I really couldn't tell you. We were maybe 5 minutes from the spot we'd hopped the fence when we had to stop. One of the guards was making a round in a golf cart, so we had to quickly duck behind a snack shack and wait for them to pass. That's when I noticed something move in the dark. At first, I thought maybe I imagined it, or maybe it was a shadow from the golf cart's headlights bouncing off something weird, but then Charles tapped my arm and pointed in the same direction. I focused my gaze a bit more and confirmed it. about 30 ft away, just barely visible in the darkness between two buildings, was another person. They were crouching down just like us, like they were also sneaking around and trying to avoid the guards. It didn't look like a kid, though. The worst part about it was that I was fairly confident they were looking directly at us. At this point, we were actually kind of scared. Between the patrolling guards and now this, the situation was getting a little overwhelming. As much as we wanted to, we still couldn't move. The guards still hadn't passed yet. I kept my eyes glued to the figure and they actually started moving. They darted across a patch of open ground and right through the little spill of light coming from a nearby street lamp. For a split second, I saw him clearly. It was a man like I suspected. He was wearing tattered clothing and had this really awkward stripe like he was injured or disfigured. But none of that was as unsettling as the dark liquid smeared across his face. It looked like blood. Charles saw it, too, and the two of us exchanged a really terrified look. Eventually, the man ducked out of sight. The guard finally passed us, and we kept moving. We didn't say a word as we made our way back to the fence. I kept checking over my shoulder every few seconds, convinced we were being followed, but no one was there. We made it back to the fence, scaled it the same way we came in and dropped down on the other side. The difference was this time we didn't laugh about it. All I wanted was to be back in the safe confines of our tent. I could tell Charles was thinking the same thing. By the time we made it back to our tent, neither of us brought up sleeping. We just lay there in our sleeping bags trying to make sense of what we'd seen. The best we could come up with was that it was some homeless guy doing god knows what. A stupid explanation, I know, but we couldn't think of anything else. The next morning started off normally. We got up, had a bite to eat, and started packing our gear to go fishing. But around 10:00 a.m., one of the camp staffers came around to our tent site and gave us an announcement that the whole campsite was supposed to hear. Apparently, a man had been stabbed and killed the night before at a lake about 4 mi away from the campground. They weren't giving many details, but the guy who did it was still on the loose, and the local sheriff's office had asked all park rangers and campsite staff within a certain mile radius to be on high alert. They described him as a disheveled white male in his late 30s, shirtless, possibly bleeding, or with blood on his clothes. Then they instructed us to pack our things and leave for our own safety. Charles and I instantly connected the dots. It must have been that guy we had seen the night before. We kept our mouths shut. We didn't tell my dad. We didn't tell the Rangers. And I still don't really know why. I know I'm going to get a bunch of hate for this. And I get it. But at that age, I was more convinced with staying out of trouble than anything else. I still kick myself for not speaking up. My statement could have led to the capture of a dangerous person who may have gone on to commit more crime. I'm still close with Charles. We went to the same college, graduated together, and work in similar fields. This experience is something we don't often talk about, though. If I'm being honest, I think Charles feels much more guilty about not speaking up than I do. Mistakes and regret aside, though, I think it's crazy that my friend and I were mere feet away from a murderer on the run. I don't like thinking about what could have happened had we crossed paths that night.

    # WORKPLACE/NIGHT SHIFT (3 scripts - 20%)
    """
I used to work nights as a security guard in a medium-sized corporate office building in New Jersey. And for the most part, the nights were boring, quiet, and uneventful. Which is why what happened one night has stuck with me so vividly for years. It started around midnight after the last employees had left the building and the lobby was empty except for me. Just me and the glow of the security monitors. My job was simple. Check cameras, make a couple of patrol rounds, log any incidents, and mostly just sit and watch for anything unusual. That night, I was going through my usual routine, scanning the screens for the elevators, the hallways, and the underground parking garage, when I noticed a figure moving between the cars on the lower garage feed, which immediately caught my attention because the lot should have been completely empty at this hour. Only people with 24-hour access could get in, and I knew no one had it at that moment. At first, I thought it might have been one of the late shift IT guys or maybe a cleaning crew member, but it didn't make sense since cleaning crews had left hours before and the guy wasn't carrying any equipment or wearing a uniform. He was wearing a long dark coat that looked a little oversized, and he wasn't heading to any particular car or toward the exit. He just moved slowly, weaving around the rows like he was inspecting the area or making sure no one was around. And something about the way he moved gave me the chills. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it was off. I called the supervisor and explained what I was seeing. And he told me to stay at my post and keep an eye on the cameras, which I did, but my gut told me I needed to check it in person. So, I grabbed my flashlight and headed down to the garage. The elevator ride was long, slow, and every floor that passed seemed to echo in the shaft, making me more on edge than I cared to admit. When the doors opened on the garage level, I scanned the lot with my flashlight, and it was empty, completely quiet, the kind of quiet that presses against your ears and makes every little creek of the building sound huge. I called out, "Hello, security here." But the echo returned empty, and I didn't hear any reply. I walked slowly down the rows of cars, shining light into every dark corner, every space between vehicles, but there was nothing there. Not a single shadow, not a single person. My pulse was racing and I started to doubt myself, thinking maybe the camera was malfunctioning, or maybe it had picked up a shadow that wasn't really there. So, I went back upstairs to the lobby trying to shake it off. But as soon as I sat back down and looked at the garage feet again, there he was, standing in the exact same spot, as if he hadn't moved since I had been there. And now my stomach dropped because I knew I had just been there. And there was no way he could have gotten back into the same spot unnoticed unless he had been watching me or worse, waiting for me. I radioed my supervisor again, telling him I was going to keep watching the cameras, and he told me not to approach him unless absolutely necessary. which was easier said than done because I couldn't stop staring at him and my mind was already running through every possible scenario. For the next 20 minutes, I watched him wander slowly toward the stairwell that led to the upper floors. He moved carefully, pausing, looking over his shoulder like he was checking for someone and then disappeared from the camera just before reaching the door, which made my stomach not. I checked every other feed. Hallways, elevator lobbies, even the rooftop access. And there was nothing. No trace of him at all, which only made me feel worse because it was impossible for him to vanish that fast. And it gave me the sinking feeling that he had access to the building somehow, or he was hiding in a way that I couldn't see. I stayed at my desk, heart pounding, until the elevator dinged and opened in the lobby. Nobody was inside, but on the polished floor, I noticed wet footprints leading from the elevator out into the main lobby. Bare feet, which was wrong on so many levels because it was freezing outside and he would have had to taken his shoes off just to wander barefoot. I frozen my tracks, realizing that if he was inside the building now, he could be anywhere. And every unlocked office or storage room was a potential hiding spot. I called the local off-site patrol for backup and debated locking myself in the lobby, but something in me told me I needed to do a patrol and confirm the situation, which in retrospect was probably a mistake. I took the elevator to the fifth floor and started walking the hallway slowly, flashlight in hand, scanning every office door, checking for movement. Every creek of the building made me jump. Halfway down the hall, I saw one of the office doors slightly a jar, which shouldn't have been possible because it was always locked at night. I pushed it open with my flashlight peering inside, but the room was empty except for a sleeping computer monitor and a chair pushed in under the desk. Nothing else. I stepped out into the hall again and froze because I heard the sound of footsteps on the tile behind me. Not mine. heavy, wet, and uneven, moving fast towards me. My heart leapt into my throat, and I swung my flashlight around the hall, catching a glimpse of the dark coat at the end of the hallway. He wasn't running, but he was walking fast with a purpose. And it hit me that he had been following me the entire time, hiding just out of sight whenever I checked the cameras. I bolted, sprinting down the hall toward the stairwell, barely noticing the handrail slamming against my arm as I rushed past. The footsteps followed close enough that I could hear them clearly now, echoing in the hall. And I realized I had no idea how he had gotten inside. No idea what he wanted, and the panic was almost suffocating. I dove into the stairwell, sliding down a few steps, and slammed the door behind me as the footsteps thundered on the floor above. Then they stopped abruptly and I sat there shaking for several minutes trying to catch my breath and convincing myself I had imagined it. But the sound of my own breathing and the echo of those steps made me feel insane. When the patrol finally arrived, I was pale, sweaty, and trembling. We walked the building together floor by floor, room by room, and the garage was completely empty. No sign of the intruder, no footprints, nothing. And when we checked the cameras, the footage from the time he appeared had been overwritten or corrupted, leaving a gap in the recording that made my skin crawl even more. I quit that job within a month. Partly because of the fear and partly because I couldn't handle walking the hallways alone anymore. Especially when the garage was empty and the wind outside made the building creek because every shadow and every noise reminded me of him walking behind me just out of sight waiting. Even years later, I get anxious in parking garages or office buildings at night, and I still check over my shoulder more than I should, thinking I might see that long coat rounding a corner, hearing those wet footsteps behind me again. And I know that what I experienced wasn't supernatural. It wasn't a faceless ghost or a phantom. It was a real person, a stalker. And the thought that he had been inside that building following me, hiding just out of view, and that I might never know how he got in or what he wanted is something that still haunts me every time I think about that night.

This happened to me a few days ago. As a matter of fact, it was my first night of training as a mobile security guard. Before I tell you my story, just want to clarify that a mobile security guard is primarily a security guard that drives around in the vehicle and does site visitation where the client needs security. In this case, it's the GTA of Toronto, but this incident took place at a nearby pharmacy/med clinic in Missaga. It was my first night as a traininee, and my supervisor was a nice person showing me around on how to conduct patrols, write reports, disarm fire alarms, etc. Usually, if an alarm occurs, dispatch notifies us through the radio and asks us to attend the site where the alarm is happening. However, we arrived at the medical clinic in Missag to conduct a regular perimeter patrol, which also meant there was no alarm. We arrived on the site around 1:15 a.m. to make sure everything was normal. But as we got out of the vehicle and approached the building, something was terribly wrong. For one, the underground parking garage was left open. and two, the front door of the building was busted open. My supervisor then said, "What the how is this possible? If somebody broke in, the alarm should be on." I did not know how to react to this as this was my first time at the site. And according to my supervisor, this was a new contract that the security company I work for got. We stepped in the building cautiously. But all of a sudden, my supervisor says, "Look at the elevator. It's going up at different levels." Sure enough, he was not kidding. As the elevator was moving from G1, 2, 3, and stopped at level 4, which was the very top, I asked my supervisor if he thinks someone was in here. He immediately nods and pulls out his baton. At that very moment, I was feeling sick to my stomach and started breathing heavily. At that point, I hated my job and did not want to be there. We immediately went inside the elevator and went straight to the top level. I was getting a bad feeling and some adrenaline was rushing through my body before the elevator door was about to open. As we were going up each level, I was thinking to myself like, "What if something happens or whoever this person or thing is might not leave without a fight and possibly even charge at us as the elevator door opens?" However, luckily, as we arrived at the fourth floor, no one was in front of us, but it was extremely dark. Therefore, we turned on the lights and started investigating the rooms of that floor. My supervisor told me to stick with him as even he was feeling uncomfortable. He said, I quote, "Make sure you stick with me and get ready to bust this fuck." Luckily, no one was there. So, we were very shocked and didn't know what was happening until we heard footsteps going down the stairwell. My supervisor and I were about to open the door to the stairs and chase whoever it was inside. However, just then the footsteps stopped and it was very quiet. We could only hear each other's breathing. What my supervisor said next to dispatch is something I will never forget and still is rattling around in my head. A4, call C-25. Go ahead. Dispatch, we need immediate backup. Please be advised someone's in the building with us and they're hiding downstairs, possibly armed and waiting for us to come towards them so he or they can ambush us. Dispatch then tells us to stay where we are and not approach the suspect or whoever it was downstairs as backup will be arriving shortly. At that point, my supervisor started panicking and it just made the situation even worse. I mean, he should be the one to lead and not feel worried. But then again, I don't blame him as this experience was overwhelming and horrifying for me. Now, my supervisor is only a couple of years older than me, so I preferably call him bro instead of sir or whatever. Bro, just don't worry. I'm sure backup will be arriving shortly, I told him. You might be wondering why we could not hit the exit and run for it. Well, you see, the suspect is on the ground floor, which means he could be anywhere. So, with the elevator making noises, he or she could be alarmed and immediately stand in front of the elevator, blocking our way. The suspect could approach us by coming upstairs, but I guess that he or they figured we could attack him by surprise. So maybe that's why he was quietly waiting at the corner for us downstairs. 15 minutes later, we heard the door open. It was our senior supervisor and his voice echoed out, "Security." My supervisor radioed him and said, "Sir, we're upstairs. Be careful. There's someone downstairs." A few minutes later, the senior supervisor met us upstairs and told us to come investigate with him. Therefore, we did. But we looked everywhere downstairs and then each floor and found no one. As we were at the third floor, scanning each room and bathroom to see if the person was there, we heard the front door open and heard footsteps running outside. We were not fast enough to see who it was because by the time we got to the ground floor, the suspect was gone. Both my supervisor and I were in shock because we looked everywhere and did not find anyone. Either that person was in a very good hiding spot or that medical clinic center was haunted. I don't think I'll ever know. But this was by far the most horrific experience of my life. And coming this weekend, I'll be there again for site visitation, but this time alone as I'll be trained by Man.

If you want to get your hands on an exclusive premium hoodie just for the 2025 Halloween season, click the link in the description that will only be available until Halloween. I've been with my company now for a good amount of time. I'd say probably about 6 years now. Thanks to the amount of time I've put in, I have seniority over the other associates. Not to mention, I have a lot more training and credentials under my belt than they do. The company recently picked up a new contract for some kind of big government office building. Where it's located is rather strange for it to be a government office building. I won't get into exact locations, but to give you an idea of what the area it's located in looks like and what makes it so strange is that it's located in damn near the middle of nowhere. It's a giant six-story building surrounded by a giant parking lot. The parking lot is surrounded by a metal fence that's about 10 ft tall. On the top of the fence is barbed wire. There's only one way in and one way out in front of the building at the opening of the parking lot that meets the side road that it's located off of. The side road is about 3 mi away from the main road which leads to the highway. The fence is completely surrounded by woods. There are literally no buildings, houses, or any other signs of civilization for miles around. Due to my seniority, I get to work whatever shifts and days I want. Typically, I choose to work mornings or evenings and have weekends or Fridays and Saturdays off. But unfortunately, after a few months of us being at this new contract, we started having trouble keeping the overnight people. During the day, there's usually about three guards working all seven days of the week. On the overnight shift during the weekdays, there's two guards. And on the overnight shift during the weekend, starting Friday to Sunday, there was only one guard. I should mention before I go any further that every guard is armed on every shift. As I said, we're having trouble keeping people on the overnight shift, mainly on the weekend overnight shift. Because of this, my supervisor asked me if I could help out until they could hire more people and work some overtime on the weekend overnight shifts. I could have, and in hindsight, should have said no thanks. But at the time, I actually needed the extra money because I was getting ready to move to a new apartment soon. So, I went ahead and accepted the extra shifts. The first couple of weeks were fine. No issues, nothing strange. But what happened on the third weekend is what made me regret my decision for the overtime. It was a Saturday night around 2:00 a.m. There was a very bad thunderstorm going on outside. I was sitting in the camera control room, which is on the top floor. The control room has a window that oversees the back part of the parking lot. In the room, there's three large-sized computer screens that show the CCTV live feeds from all the cameras located throughout the building, as well as the few cameras that are outside in the parking lot and by the entrance/exit of the parking lot. I was sitting in the control room doing what I normally was doing while working overnight by myself. I had the lights off watching movies I previously downloaded on my phone while also playing games on my Game Boy. I had been sitting down for a while and got up to stretch my legs and move around a bit. I was also starting to feel a little sleepy and was thinking about going down the hall to the vending machine and grabbing an energy drink. After I got up and walked around the control room for a bit, stretching my legs, I went over to the window, peeked through the blinds to look outside. As I was watching, I was looking at all the heavy wind and rain blowing the random debris around. I was just about to walk away from the window to grab that energy drink when all of a sudden a flash of lightning lit up the surrounding area past the fence. And just then, I saw a figure dart from one tree to another that was a good distance from it. I'd say about 20 ft. I kept my position, looking in that direction through the blinds, waiting for another flash of lightning to see if I could see exactly what it was or if my eyes were playing tricks on me. After a couple of seconds went by, another flash struck. This time I didn't see anything near or around the tree that I saw the figure move to. At that point I thought clearly my eyes were playing tricks on me and that it was just me being tired. I left from the window and went down the hall and got the energy drink. I immediately downed the whole thing hoping that it would kick in soon. I was finished with it by the time it took me to walk back to the control room which wasn't long, only about 5 minutes. I got back to the control room and I immediately noticed that one of the camera feeds had been knocked out on one of the screens. It was the camera feed to the back part of the parking lot that the window overlooked. I went over to the window and looked out the blinds in the direction of the camera. I spotted it dangling in the wind from its wires from the post that it was on. I figured the heavy winds must have knocked it off somehow. I sat back at my desk and put in my report for the night and then went back to what I was originally doing. A few minutes had passed while I was watching a movie on my phone and I heard the alert sound the system gives when someone is accessing a part of the building that requires a code to be entered on a keypad. I looked at the main screen and pulled up the tab that shows the access points of the building. It showed me the one being accessed was the one in the back of the building by the back parking lot. At that point, a shiver ran down my spine as I realized someone was outside. from the shadow figure to the camera being knocked out and now to this the keypad being accessed. Whoever it was had the code because they got in and the system showed me the green light. I thought to myself, it couldn't be another worker or security guard. If it was a worker, we would have a memo telling us who it was and what times they would be here, as well as what part of the building they would be in. I knew it wasn't a security guard because I would have known about that, too. I picked up the phone that was on my desk in an attempt to call the cops, but it was out. I looked at my phone and of course, no service. I figured the best thing to do would be to try to walk around the hallway and try to get service on my phone. I left out of the control room and into the hallway. I started walking down the hallway toward the service stairwell while looking at my phone, hoping to get a signal soon. Just then, as I was looking down at my phone, the power was shut off. I immediately decided since I was so close to the stairs that I was going to run down the stairs to the front lobby and run out the door to my truck. I got to the stairwell and opened it up. It was damn near pitch black in there. I decided to use the darkness to my advantage and walk quietly down the steps. I figured if this person cut the power, they had to be in the generator room, which was in the basement. Unfortunately, the basement was the only flight of steps below the lobby where I was headed. Also, the generator was not too far away from the stairwell that I was in. I made it down to the fourth floor and suddenly I heard a door open at the bottom of the stairwell. I stopped dead in my tracks. At this point, I knew I was armed, but I was thinking to myself, even though I went through training, I don't think I was ready to shoot anyone. I was hoping and praying that it wouldn't come to that. As I was standing there immersed in my thoughts about my training with my firearm, I started hearing heavy footsteps walking up the stairs. I wasted no time in coming up with a new plan. I was going to turn around and walk as quickly and quietly back up the steps as possible to the sixth floor where I came from. At the top of the steps, a few feet past the door still in the stairwell, there's a ladder that leads up to the hatch that leads to the roof of the building. I was going to climb up the ladder to the top just before you have to open the hatch to go any further and just hide in there in the pitch black darkness until whatever happens next. I turned around just as I did. My gun banged against the metal to the stairwell railing, making a loud clang sound. As that happened, I froze and so did the heavy footsteps. A few seconds had gone by and then I heard whoever it was running as fast as they could up the steps. I sprang as fast as I could, running up the steps as if my life depended on it. As I got to the top of the steps, just before I was about to pass the door I had come from, I had an idea to create a diversion on the fly. I quickly opened up the door hard and loud, then let go of the handle and let it close and slam on its own. I continued to run to the ladder and climb up it. By doing that, I would make it appear that I had run out the door. With only seconds to spare, I made it up the ladder. The man, distracted by the door tactic, opened it without even looking in my direction. He ran into the hall, the heavy door closing behind him. That's when I saw my chance. I leapt down from the ladder only about 10 ft high, landing with a loud thud as my feet hit the floor. I bolted for the stairs. The man must have heard the sound because I had barely made it down one flight before I heard the door open again and his footsteps pounding down after me. Both of us were sprinting as fast as we could. I managed to stay one floor ahead of him the entire way. When I reached the lobby, luck was suddenly on my side. Behind me, I heard a loud crashing noise followed by a cry of pain. I wasn't certain, but I think the man had tripped and fallen on the stairs. I wasn't about to wait around to confirm. I burst through the door, ran straight for the entrance, and used my key to unlock it. Fortunately, I always parked my truck close by. With the wind howling and the rain pouring down, I hit the fob to start the engine and unlocked the doors as I sprinted across the lot. I jumped into the truck, threw it in reverse, and just then caught sight of him, dressed all in black, his face covered by a mask and hood, bursting out of the building and charging toward my car. I slammed the gear into drive and floored it, tires screeching as I tore out of the lot and onto the side road. It wasn't until I was nearly at the main road that I got a signal on my phone. I immediately called the police. They arrived about 15 minutes later and I followed them back to the building. I told them everything, filling out reports for both them and my company. We searched the entire building and surrounding area, but found nothing. The scariest part came when they checked the stairwell. Apparently, when the man had fallen, he dropped something. The police recovered a fully loaded, unregistered semi-automatic handgun. To this day, no one knows why someone would have broken into that building. There was nothing particularly special about it, except that it was government property. Whatever the case, I'm just thankful that luck was on my side that night.

    # HOME/CHILDHOOD (2 scripts - 13%)
    """
This one's from when I was a kid. It's not something I talk about much or even think about really. Whenever I do, it gives me an icky feeling inside. Hard to describe. Maybe writing it down will give me some measure of release or whatever, but who knows? I went to a boarding school out in the suburbs. I was there starting in 8th grade and I ended up staying through most of high school. I shared a room with this kid named Weston. We weren't close at first, just kind of thrown together like everyone else, but over time we got used to each other. The room itself was basic, two beds, two desks, and a tiny shared closet. After a few weeks, I started picking up on some weird stuff about Weston. For starters, he gave me a list of items I wasn't allowed to bring back to the room, completely out of the blue, too. Like, he just walked up to me with a folded piece of paper as if it were some customary thing to be expected of a roommate. As if that wasn't strange enough, the list itself was even stranger. There were a bunch of random things on it that didn't even remotely make sense. I can't remember all of it, but apparently, I wasn't allowed to bring frogs into the room, as if I ever had any intention of doing that. I didn't even know where anyone would even find a frog, let alone why they would bring it into their room. But the strangest thing on the list by far was salt. You don't eat salt, so I couldn't imagine why he'd feel the need to tell me that. What did he think I just bring a salt shaker to the room for no reason? That was absurd. Plus, it was frowned upon to bring any food items back to your dorm, which added to the mystery. And beyond that, what kind of problem could Salt even pose in the first place? As far as I knew, salt allergies weren't a thing. So, I couldn't imagine what he was trying to avoid with that one. It was just bizarre, especially because of how serious he was about it. You might be thinking it was his form of a joke, but I'm telling you, this kid did not know what humor was. He also had this habit of muttering to himself, not just occasionally, like full-on whispering under his breath, especially at night when the lights were off. I'd catch little pieces of it sometimes, like he was talking to someone, but there was never anyone else in the room. It was really freaky at first, especially when he accidentally woke me up while doing it. But like everything else, I eventually got used to it. He also kept this little notebook, which wasn't anything crazy until I realized what was in it. The way he never let anyone see it made me think it was something embarrassing or personal, but I was wrong. I knew for a fact that he kept it buried under his mattress, and my curiosity swelled over this time, ultimately getting the better of me. One day, when he was out of the room, I felt around under his mattress until I found it. The vast majority of it was empty, but there were a few pages that had writing on them. It took me all of 2 seconds to realize what I was looking at. It was a long list of names, and a bunch were scratched out. I read through it and realized that a bunch of the names were kids I knew from school. I frantically scanned it for my name and I was horrified to actually find it in there on one of the last pages. It wasn't crossed out, which I figured was a good thing, but I had no idea what any of it meant. There wasn't anything else in there, though, just the names, most of which were not crossed out. I tried deciphering it, but there was nothing special about the list. As I was putting it back, I couldn't help but wonder why someone would be so secretive over something so harmless. Were it not for the way Weston protected that thing with his life, I probably would have brushed it off as a list of people he didn't like at school or something. But for whatever reason, seeing that list gave me this really sick feeling inside, like Weston was more than just a socially awkward kid. For weeks after that, I was extremely paranoid that he somehow knew what I had done. and I started worrying that he was going to do something to me. We didn't interact much to begin with, but I could have sworn I caught him glaring at me much more often than he ever had. This unexplainable sense of fear started hanging over me, and I gradually spent more and more time outside my dorm. I had a decent amount of friends and it got to a point where I was spending more time in my friend's dorms than my own. Then one night, something happened that made all my paranoia feel justified. I woke up randomly in the middle of the night. I had no idea what time it was, but it was pitch black outside and I couldn't see anything. At first, I thought I had woken up to Weston's muttering again, but as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I realized the reality was much worse. Weston wasn't muttering. That's because instead, he was literally towering over my bed, just standing there in the dark, smiling. His hands were slightly raised, like he was about to do something, but had frozen mid-motion. I screamed. I couldn't help myself, and I sat up in the bed. Despite my outburst, he didn't stop smiling. He didn't even flinch at my scream. He just kept looking down at me without even altering his stance. The shock of having been woken up like that was one thing, but the way he didn't even react made it even scarier. When I finally demanded to know what he was doing, he just said I'd been talking in my sleep. Like that shell of a response somehow explained everything. Like it was totally normal to be standing over someone's bed at 2:00 in the morning. I didn't know what to say. I was still partly in shock and the way he kept smiling even after explaining himself discouraged me from asking any more questions. He went back to his bed without another word. I stayed awake the rest of the night and not by choice. The next morning, I tried bringing it up. I felt more comfortable and honestly more safe asking him about it now that there was daylight in the room. But he acted confused, like he genuinely didn't know what I was talking about. Not in an angry way either, more in like an okay man, whatever you say kind of way, like he thought I was making it up as some kind of joke. I couldn't decide whether he was just a really good liar or whether he truly didn't remember the incident. I couldn't decide which was worse. After that, my fear only got worse. And not just of Weston. It's hard to explain, but I started being afraid of the room itself, like his presence had infected it somehow. Even when he wasn't there, I felt uncomfortable in my own dorm. Things only got worse. About a week later, I came back to the room one night to find a small garden snake on my bed. I'm not kidding. There was a live snake on my bed. I again screamed and looked over at Weston, who was just sitting there at his desk with this blank expression on his face. He actually apologized this time and said that it was just meant to be a harmless prank. But I didn't take it that way. When I asked where he'd even gotten a snake in the first place, he looked at me all confused and said something I will never forget. He said, "What do you mean? They're everywhere." I didn't know what to say to that. I was worried that if I said the wrong thing, he might actually try to hurt me. I had never seen a single snake on campus, but we were surrounded by woods, so maybe he was right. But what really freaked me out was when he opened this jar on his desk and the snake just slithered right in all on its own, like it wanted to be captured. I didn't understand how a wild animal would just do that. The whole thing from finding the snake to his creepy response to the way it behaved was freaky. Freakier than I'm describing it. I didn't report it. My young and naive self just couldn't get over what Weston would do if I got him in trouble. That's the thing you have to remember. I was just so young. I was 13. I wasn't old enough to know how to deal with the situation. The breaking point came from a few nights later. It started with what I thought was a nightmare. I was in sleep paralysis, totally unable to move, and there was this dark mass swirling around the ceiling. It was kind of like a blob and kind of like a cloud and it was pulsing like it was alive or at least breathing. It kept shifting and moving and I could only watch as it started descending toward my bed. Then this claw or something like a claw emerged from the mass and started scratching at my bed frame. And then it started reaching for me. But before it could grab me, it suddenly recoiled like something had burned it or scared it off. And then it went completely crazy. It started flying around the room really fast like it was angry or wounded. It knocked a bunch of stuff off our desks and rummaged through our closet. And in one abrupt motion, it flew towards the window and smashed right through it, disappearing into the darkness outside. The second I heard the shattering glass, my eyes snapped open. Only my neck was already pointed in the direction of the window, like I had been facing that way the whole time. And all at once, I realized why that was so terrifying. The window was actually shattered. What's worse was that there were shards of glass falling to the floor in real time like it had just been broken moments ago. The rest of the room looked identical to what the scene in my dream had looked like. It was a perfect one toone match. Despite being confident that I was now awake, I still couldn't move. But it was the most terrifying moment of my life. I tore my eyes away from the window and realized there were long scratches in my bed frame in the exact spot that claw in my dream had scraped. The fear didn't go away, but the paralysis did. As soon as I could move again, my first thought was that Weston had done it somehow. I went to his bed, but he was fast asleep. He was even snoring, but I wasn't going to let him fool me again. I started shaking him, knowing he was faking it, but he didn't wake up. I kept shaking him and the longer he stayed asleep, the more desperately I wished he'd wake up. It was such a nasty feeling. I was both deathly terrified of him and deathly terrified of what it would mean if he hadn't been behind the whole thing. If my nightmare hadn't been a nightmare. The moment I started thinking about that possibility, I started shaking. I wanted to be able to blame him for what had happened or at least have some other person to make me feel less lonely and afraid. But he didn't wake up. It was too much for me to handle. I went back to my bed, curled up in a ball, and started crying. I didn't know what else to do. The broken window was real. The ransacked room was real. The scratches in the bed frame were real. A few minutes later, Weston finally woke up. He seemed genuinely shocked at the state of the room. I thought that meant we were in it together, but no. Instead, he accused me of having gone through his stuff, and we got into a screaming match. I couldn't believe he was trying to blame the whole thing on me when he was the psychotic one. He started hissing at me like a cat and then he started yelling in a foreign language, one I had never heard before. It was not normal. Normal people don't do that. I felt like he was about to attack me. Things get kind of blurry after that. The RA showed up at our door, probably because of all the noise, and he escorted both of us out. I ended up sleeping in a vacant room that night. When I woke up the next morning, I was freezing. It took me a few seconds to realize why. The window in that room was wide open, even though I definitely remember it being closed. No one else was supposed to be in there. That was the nail in the coffin. My brain was already working on a rational explanation for what had happened the night before. But seeing that open window destroyed it all. One of the RAs told me to go get my things from my old room. When I got there, all of Weston's stuff was already gone. He must have cleared it out earlier that morning. Nobody told me what was going on. The administration just moved me to a different room with a different roommate. When I asked about Weston, they said he was no longer my concern. I never saw him again. Honestly, I don't remember much about the remainder of my time at that school. I think my brain just shut everything down and locked everything out as a last resort or some kind of coping mechanism. I don't think I'll ever know what was wrong with that kid, Weston. But I don't care. I've thought of every possible explanation for what happened that night, and none of them make any sense. The window was broken from the inside. Anything that might have smashed it from the outside would have been lying on the floor. And I have trouble convincing myself that it was Weston, not only because of how heavily he had been sleeping, but also because of how quickly I had woken up after the nightmare. I would have seen him rushing back to his bed. Something abnormal happened that night and it terrifies me to think that I might have witnessed it. That my nightmare hadn't been a nightmare.

When I was little, my parents would send me to my grandparents farm in Pennsylvania for 2 weeks every summer. The house sat on 40 acres of mostly woods. It was honestly more woods than farm. My cousin Francisco would come for different weeks because our parents wanted to give our grandparents a break between visits. I always went first two weeks of July. He always went last two weeks of August. The house had three floors, but the third floor was just an attic with one finished room that used to be my dad's when he was my age. That's where I slept. The ceiling slanted down on both sides, and there was one window that overlooked the backyard into the woods. My grandparents went to bed early, usually before 9:00. My parents told me it was rude to stay up past them, so I'd stay in my room after they wished me good night. I wouldn't sleep, though. I would stay up reading with a flashlight or playing my Game Boy. There wasn't much else to do there. The first summer went by without incident, but I started noticing weird things the second summer I was there. On one of the first nights, I was reading in bed when I heard footsteps on the attic stairs. They sounded soft, like someone was trying to be quiet. I watched as the door handle turned and pushed open about 6 in. As soon as I saw the door opening, I shut my light off and pretended to be asleep. I honestly thought it was my grandma coming to check on me, and I was worried that I'd get in trouble if she found out I was awake, but I didn't hear anything after that. No receding footsteps or the sound of the door closing. I forced myself to sleep, assuming I had either missed my grandma leaving or she was still watching me for whatever reason. The next morning, I told my grandpa about the footsteps. He said the house was old and made noises and that raccoons sometimes got in the walls. I thought that was an especially strange explanation because I was pretty sure I had seen the door handle turn, but I didn't want to say that the footsteps were far too soft to be his anyway. So, I just assumed it was my grandma and he wasn't actually aware of it. Three nights later, I woke up. Or at least I thought I woke up because my bed was shaking. There was someone standing at the foot of my bed. It was dark, but I could see their outline. I couldn't tell which of my grandparents it was, but it still scared me nonetheless. I closed my eyes and silently counted to a hundred. When I opened them, the person was gone. I convinced myself it had just been a nightmare, but it didn't feel like one. When I woke up the next morning, my closet door was open, even though I knew it had been closed the night before, which made me doubt whether I had truly been asleep. I started suspecting my grandma was spying on me while I was asleep, as stupid as that sounds. It was the only explanation that made sense to me. Elderly people don't always have the best control over their minds, after all. It was scary, but I didn't want to bring it up to my grandparents again out of fear of upsetting or disrespecting them. Similar things happened periodically over the course of that week and the next. And when it came time to go home, I was relieved. When my mom picked me up, I told her everything. She laughed and said it was impossible to get my grandma out of bed after she fell asleep. Then she told me I had an active imagination and that old houses were creepy. She said Francisco never complained about anything when he stayed there. That made me feel like maybe I really was just imagining things. I went back the next summer and the same things happened. I never actually saw my grandma's face, but I knew it was her. I started going to sleep much earlier to reduce the risk of being awake for something creepy to happen. Years went by. My parents stopped sending me to my grandparents farm after a certain age, and a big part of me was relieved. My grandparents passed away when I was in college within mere weeks of each other. The funeral was the most depressing thing ever. Besides how sad it was, I had to converse with a bunch of relatives I hadn't seen in years, which I wasn't thrilled about. One such relative was Francisco, who I actually hadn't interacted with much, even though we were around the same age. It took less than a minute for me to realize I had nothing in common with him. Besides our age, the only thing we really did have in common was our shared time at the farm. So, I asked him about it, not really knowing what else to talk about and feeling like something related to our grandparents was a valid topic of conversation. I told him about what I had experienced there. The footsteps, the figure, the closet door. I even told my theory about it being our grandma. I expected him to laugh or maybe agree with me, but I was wrong. With a blank expression, he said, and I'll never forget this, "That's nothing. That thing used to touch me." I listened in horror as he described things that were categorically worse than what I had experienced. He said the same figure would stand at the foot of his bed every few nights, but it didn't just watch him like it watched me. He would feel the mattress sink down like it was sitting. Then he would feel fingers on his face tracing his features. Sometimes it would grab his wrist and hold it. He said he kept his eyes shut and remained frozen in place until it left. I asked him how he knew it wasn't one of our grandparents. And he said, almost like it was obvious that he could feel it, that the thing that was touching him had rough and scratchy hands, unlike either of our grandparents. I looked at him in shock. I genuinely couldn't believe what he was telling me. Why would he keep something like that to himself? I asked him that and he said he didn't. That he told his mom about the occurrences several times. She didn't believe him and actually got mad when he'd complained about it to her. So, he stopped talking about it and told himself that as long as he kept his eyes closed and didn't move, everything would be okay. Hearing him tell me that was quite literally horrifying. Not only did it confirm everything I myself had been experiencing, but it made things so much worse. Francisco and I stopped talking about it after that, and I could tell both of us just wanted to forget about the shared nightmare and leave it in the past with the rest of our childhood. But if it wasn't my grandma who was coming into my room at night, I don't like thinking about what it could mean. The way Francisco described it as a thing is something that still freaks me out. But is it any better thinking about how it might have been a human being? That would mean there was a person my grandparents didn't know about living in their house for years. I don't know which is worse.

    # PURSUIT/STALKER (2 scripts - 13%) - Kept minimal representation
    """
There's a quick check off the highway not too far away from where I live. It's the only thing open 24/7 in my rural middle of nowhere town. It's about a 25-minute drive if I'm speeding, which I usually am. So, to translate for all you city folk, it's basically right next door. My sleep schedule is beyond atrocious, so I've been to that quick check more than a handful of times. I like to think I'm pretty generic looking and nondescript, meaning I blend in well, but it wouldn't surprise me if some of the late night workers recognize me by now. This happened just last week, so most of the details are still painfully fresh in my mind. It was past midnight, and I was coding on my laptop. My productivity and focus peaked between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. So, I was in that flow state that any hard worker craves. The problem with late night grinding is that you go from perfectly comfortable to dying of hunger in a matter of minutes, which is exactly what prompted me to shut things down and grab something to eat around the reasonable hour of 2:00 a.m. Just so you have an understanding of everything, I should mention that the highway leading to the quick check is more of a local road than an interstate, so it's usually pretty dead. The ride there was relatively uneventful. I pulled into the quick check, ordered a sandwich from one of the counters, and roamed the aisles while I waited. The mix of caffeine I'm usually stimmed out on and the ADHD I was born with makes it difficult for me to sit still. So, I was just kind of pacing around one of the corners of the store when I noticed something. Facing one of the refrigerators that lined the back of the store was a person sitting crisscross on the ground. It was such an odd sight that I initially overlooked it, then snapped my head back around to make sure I hadn't imagined it, and I hadn't. There was literally a person sitting on the ground at the end of the aisle, facing the refrigerator like he was examining it. I couldn't see anything other than the brown coat and jeans he was wearing. I needed to get a better look at this guy, at his face at least. So, I walked a few aisles down. My plan was to turn the corner really quickly, get a good look at him, then turn back up one of the aisles, ideally before he noticed me looking. Staring at strangers so explicitly is obviously really rude, so I didn't want him to catch me doing it. I was trying to be inconspicuous about it, or at least appear like I was browsing the snacks, but I guess I didn't do a good job of that because as soon as I turned the corner to look at him, he whipped his head around and stared back at me. His movement was so abrupt that I actually froze up for a few seconds, forgetting what I was even doing there in the first place. And let me tell you, one look at this guy confirmed he was far from normal. Forget about the sitting on the ground and staring into the refrigerator. This guy was definitely on something, which I could tell from his abnormally wide eyes and the way his lip was vibrating, like it was fully quivering, almost as if he were cold, except it was actually kind of hot in there. And he was also wearing a jacket. His posture was all twisted up too, like he was straining instead of sitting, if that makes any sense. But the worst thing by far was the look he was giving me. He wasn't smiling, and he wasn't scowlling either. He was staring blankly at me with this deady stare that made it kind of seem like he actually was dead. The whole scene was freaky as hell. After staring at each other for an uncomfortable amount of time, I finally averted my eyes and dipped up one of the aisles, eager to get my food and leave. It wasn't ready yet, though. I stood at the counter and waited. The anxiety was getting to me, so I angled myself to face the corner of the store where the guy had been sitting. I was half expecting him to emerge from one of the aisles, at which point I'm not sure what I would have done, but he never did. Eventually, my food was ready. I promptly left the store without another thought. I thought that was the end of it. But as I was turning to get back on the highway, I saw something move out of the corner of my eye. I glanced back towards the store and saw a person running full speed from the store entrance to the far end of the parking lot. I was already halfway onto the highway at that point, but as soon as I saw what looked like a brown coat, I knew it was him. As I drove past the quick check, I looked over at it one more time to see that guy was now jumping into a truck. I didn't even want to imagine what a guy like that could possibly be rushing to do at 2:00 a.m. I was just happy I had nothing to do with it. I sped off, just wanting to get home in peace. After a few minutes, the last of the fluorescent storefront lights faded into darkness behind me, and I was driving through desolate nothingness once again. I'm used to being the only car on the road when it's that late at night, which is why it was so surprising when I noticed headlights in my rearview mirror. But it was even more surprising when I realized the headlights were getting closer, meaning they were going faster than me, and I wasn't exactly driving the speed limit. My first thought was that I was about to get pulled over, so I instinctively slowed down a bit. The headlights kept approaching, and I knew what was about to happen. Police lights were about to start flashing, and my night was about to be ruined. But once the car finally got close enough, I realized it wasn't a cop. It was that guy. That guy from the quick check. It was the same car from the parking lot. I've never been more certain of anything in my life. I slammed my foot back on the gas and got back up to speed. The guy behind me started flashing his lights at me and honking, and I didn't know what to do. Try and outrun him or pull over and just pray that he'd keep going. I was in a sedan and he was driving a pickup truck, so I figured I could outrun him. The faster I went though, the more terrified I became. I can only describe that feeling as true terror. The feeling that you're literally approaching death. By the time I'd gotten up to 100 mph, the voice in my head was screaming that I was going to die if I kept accelerating. I swerved into the right lane, hoping he'd shoot by me, but instead he actually swerved to stay behind me. I started slowing down with the intention of pulling over on the shoulder. But the moment I took my foot off the gas, the truck actually rammed into me. I grabbed the wheel to stabilize the car and realized I was in a life ordeath situation. The guy telling me was trying to kill me. Everything was happening so fast. I couldn't think. I knew he was going to try ramming me again. And at that speed, I knew I would be lucky not to spin out. I don't know if it was the terror or my survival instincts kicking in. But the moment I saw him go for it, I swerved to the left and slammed on the brakes. The truck shot past me and I watched as he swerved back and forth a few times before spinning out and shooting off the highway into the field. Despite how violently my hands were shaking and how terrified I was, I forced myself to start driving again. I sped the entire way home. As soon as I got inside, I called the police and reported the incident. Although it's not like I could precisely describe where everything had gone down. They took my statement anyway and I was happy to give it. I know for a fact that quick check had security cameras in their parking lot, so I'm pretty confident they'll end up catching that guy. It's only been a week since this happened, but I haven't heard anything yet. My car isn't dinged up too badly, but I still need to get it repaired. As for why in the world that guy had gone after me, your guess is as good as mine. I just hope I never see him again.

This happened in the summer of 2022. I was 25 and working what I guess you'd call an unusual logistics job. I was hauling refurbished electronics and custom PC parts for this last mile delivery startup that was trying to compete with Amazon and weird rural markets. The routes were long and completely erratic. Sometimes I'd be driving for 12 hours straight, often through the night, hitting these remote parts of the Southwest that most delivery companies refused to touch. The pay was decent enough to make it worth it, and I didn't mind the long drive since I had grown up in a road tripping type family. This particular night, I was deep into the final leg of a Phoenix to Lovington run. It was around 1:00 in the morning and I was winding through this desolate stretch of Route 82 past the outskirts of Lincoln National Forest in southern New Mexico. If you've never driven through that area at night, it's hard to describe how isolated it feels. The road is narrow and poorly lit. You might see another car every 20 or 30 minutes if you're lucky. But here's the thing about that particular stretch. It's also the only accessible route cutting through the area for miles. The GPS alternatives would add like 2 hours to the trip, winding you way north through Kariso or something like that. So if you needed to get from point A to point B in that part of New Mexico, you pretty much have to take Route 82. Anyway, I was listening to some true crime podcasts when I rounded this bend and saw a red hatchback awkwardly pulled onto the gravel shoulder with its hazards flashing. I slowed down a bit out of habit. As I got closer, my headlights illuminated a woman standing next to the car. She was holding her phone high in the air like she was trying to catch a signal. My first instinct was to just drive past. I mean, I'm not heartless, but I'm also not naive about the kinds of situations you can walk into in that part of the state at that time of night. But then I started thinking about my own girlfriend or my sister and how I would want someone to stop if they were stranded in the middle of nowhere. Plus, I wasn't completely defenseless. I had a Glock 43 holstered just under my steering column. I never explicitly got permission from the company to arm myself, but given some of the areas we delivered to, it seems like common sense to me. I slowed down and cracked the passenger window a couple inches. The woman, who didn't seem much older than me, rushed over immediately and tried my passenger door handle, which was locked. She said she needed a ride to the nearest gas station and claimed her car had just died and she couldn't get anyone on the phone. Her voice had this jittery quality to it, like she was either really stressed or maybe on something. I hesitated for a few seconds. The situation felt a little off, but what tipped the scale was knowing I had a firearm within reach. I figured if things got sketchy, I'd be able to handle myself. So, I unlocked the door. She got in quickly and gave me this vague and slightly slurred, "Thank you so much," without really looking at me. The way she slurred her words made me think she was drunk or maybe a little tipsy, which made me a little cautious. Before driving away, I asked her some obvious questions. Had she hit something or did the engine cut out, that sort of thing. But she kept deflecting, repeatedly, asking me to just drive. Nothing she said really made sense, and I was leaning towards kicking her out of my car the more she talked. I was about to make a decision when I glanced over at her car one more time. To my horror, a man stepped out from behind it like he had been hiding there the whole time. The adrenaline started to kick and I turned to face forward. There was another figure that had stepped directly in front of the road about 50 ft in front of us. There was something long in his hands, maybe a bat or a pipe. I couldn't tell exactly. He started moving toward my car and that's when my survival instinct took over. I floored it. I didn't even try to be subtle about it. The woman whipped around to look back and immediately started yelling. Then she reached down and started digging around in her purse for something. I had a feeling I knew what she was looking for. So before things could escalate, I yelled at her to freeze and drew my gun. I didn't point it at her, but instead just rested it on the steering wheel so she could see it. Whatever she had been reaching for, she stopped immediately. I told her not to move and she didn't. To my surprise, she stopped talking, too. She just stared straight ahead with this expression I couldn't read. Luckily for her, we were less than 30 minutes from Artisia. After a somewhat tense half hour, I pulled into a gas station. There were two other vehicles in the lot, both big rigs. I told her to get out. She refused at first and gave me some stupid reason I can't remember. But I leaned across her, yanked the passenger door open, and basically forced her out of the truck. She stumbled back and fell onto the pavement, all the while yelling something completely incomprehensible. Someone started jogging over, probably one of the truckers, and I could already envision the accusations that were about to fly. All that guy had seen was me throwing a woman out of the car, and I didn't want to deal with the situation for a second longer. So, I didn't. I yelled out a warning to him about her ill intentions, but that was all I was going to do. Then, I peeled out of the lot before that guy could approach me and didn't look back. I drove to another gas station and started filling my tank. Then, I walked over to the passenger side to inspect the seat. Buried between the seat cushions was a burner phone battery  and a sealed pack of zip ties. I didn't even want to think about it. I tossed all of it in the trash and got back on the road, eager to be done with the journey. I never reported any of it. Not to the police and definitely not to my company. Not because I didn't think it was worth reporting, but because legally speaking, I didn't really want to explain to a bunch of cops why I was driving around armed or why I had physically removed someone from my car. I'm not going to get into it, but you can connect the dots on that one yourself. One thing's for sure, though. Being armed that night may have very well saved my life.

    # ONLINE DATING (2 scripts - 13%)
    """
After turning 30 years old back in January, I started getting sick of being single. I hadn't been in a real relationship in several years, and I wanted to get back out there. I had always resisted online dating, but I eventually decided to bite the bullet and download the dating app Hinge. After a few days of using the app, I did end up with several matches, but none of them ever amounted to anything. One Monday night, I was chilling at home watching hockey when I got a phone notification from Hinge saying that I had matched with a girl named Rebecca. Her profile looked legit. She had a photo of herself at her job, a short video of her and her friends at a bar shooting darts, a picture of her at an outdoor concert, and a regular selfie of just her face. I thought she was very attractive, so I messaged her. Before long, we were having a nice conversation about our respective jobs and hobbies. She seemed cool and normal, so I asked her if she wanted to meet at a local arcade bar that Friday. She took a while to respond, something like 4 hours. At about 1:00 a.m., she finally got back to me and agreed to the date. After our plans were set, I didn't hear from her at all for 4 days until literally 30 minutes before our date. She sent a text that just said, "On my way at our agreed upon time." I pulled up to the bar and was immediately surprised by how slow the place looked. This was a Friday at 8:00 p.m. and this bar only had two cars in their parking lot. I pulled into a spot right by the front side of the bar. Mere seconds after I put my car in park, I got a text from Rebecca saying that she was having car trouble and that she was parking on the other side of the bar. This immediately struck me as super suspicious since the other side of the bar was nothing but a few dumpsters and a fence that separated the bar from the woods. It didn't make any sense how she would even end up back there. I tried calling her, but after one ring, it went to voicemail. I hung up and immediately received another text from her that said, "Please just come around back and help with my car." Alarms were going off in my head, but I wasn't immediately sure what to do. I sent her a text that just said, "This doesn't feel right. I'm leaving." I know that sounds a little dumb in retrospects, but I was seriously unsure of how to handle the situation. After sending her the text, I put my car in reverse and started leaving the parking lot. As soon as I was about to turn off the lot, two men in ski masks came running out from behind the bar straight towards my car. They didn't appear to be holding any kind of weapon, but I was definitely not going to wait around any longer to find out. I sped off all the way back to my apartment. Once I got back home, I noticed that there was a big dent on the top of my car's trunk, as if one of the guys had thrown a large rock at my car as I was speeding off. I didn't even notice a heavy object hitting my car. That's how scared I was in the moment. I called the police and told them the whole story, but at the end of the day, there wasn't much they could really do. They said they would keep me posted if any leads came up, whatever that means, but I haven't heard back from them. Weirdly, this didn't totally scare me off dating apps since I figured the odds of that happening again are very slim. Still, I'm much more careful about meeting people off of them, and I make sure to call or FaceTime women before meeting them.

I still remember that stretch of 2024 like it was yesterday. Humid city nights, cramped condo living, and the constant hum of anxiety sitting in my chest because the board exam was only a few months away. I was staying in a small condominium in the city with my three friends. All of us were buried in review materials, practice exams, and the occasional emotional breakdown disguised as a coffee break. And like every other stressed out 20some stuck between obligation and burnout, I thought it would be a great idea to distract myself with someone new. That's when I met him. Let's call him Michael. I don't know if it was the boredom, the loneliness, or just the fact that I was tired of thinking about formulas, but I found him attractive right away. He was charming in the beginning, calm, funny, the type of guy who replied fast but not too fast. It was as if he mastered the perfect balance of interest and chill. We started talking every day and then every night. And before I could fully process what I was doing, we were dating, or at least something that felt like dating. Michael was at first everything a sane person would want. Respectful, attentive, a good conversationalist. We would be on calls for hours while I lay on my thin condo mattress, staring at the ceiling and listening to his voice fill the room. The only weird thing was that he never showed his face during our calls. He claimed his phone had been stolen and the laptop he was using didn't have a functioning camera. I didn't question it at first, but slowly little red flags began popping up like notifications I kept swiping away. The biggest one, the way his tone changed whenever the topic got even remotely intimate. Out of nowhere, this man would ask me for explicit selfies every single time. I shut it down firmly every time. I wasn't comfortable with that, especially online. I told him that straight, but it was like talking to a dog in heat. No, scratch that. A dog in heat at least has the excuse of being an animal. This guy, he was worse because he knew exactly what he was doing. We'd argue about it a lot. He'd push, I'd refuse, and he'd sulk. Sometimes he'd apologize, sometimes he'd respect my boundaries, only to ask again the next day like we didn't just fight about the same thing. The cycle became exhausting. And yet, despite all of that, I still wanted to meet him in person to see if this connection was real or if I was just romanticizing a voice on the other end of a screen. But every time, and I mean every time, I suggested meeting up, he had an excuse. He had errands, he was busy, he didn't feel well, his schedule was full, he wasn't in the city, he had a family thing, he had an emergency, or the classic soon. It was always soon, but soon never came. And somewhere between the late night calls, the excuses, the constant sexual pressure, and the growing pit in my stomach, something in me began to shift. Something wasn't right with Michael. And I felt it long before I admitted it. My friends had been warning me for weeks. Every time Michael dodged a meetup, every time he gave some vague excuse about his broken camera, every time he pushed for explicit photos, but refused to show so much as half his face, my friends would exchange looks. Does he not show himself on video call at all? One of them asked one night while we were reviewing in the living room. Not even a quick flash of his face, another added. I shrugged. His phone got stolen. I reminded them for maybe the 10th time that month. And his laptop cameras broken. They stared at me like I had just announced I believed in unicorns. Marie, come on. One of them said gently. If he really wanted to see you, he would find a way. Even a 10-year-old laptop has a camera. something's off. I knew they were right. Deep down, I felt it, too. But I kept defending him. I kept telling myself he wouldn't call me every day if he wasn't serious. I kept insisting he was just going through something personal. I kept believing the version of the person he pretended to be. Then came December, weeks before Christmas. With that stupid mix of hope and denial swirling in my chest, I finally told him, "Come over, meet my family, spend Christmas with us," he sounded thrilled. He said yes instantly. No hesitation or excuses. For the first time, I let myself believe that maybe everything would pay off in the end. I pictured a sweet Christmas morning introduction, a cheesy meet my boyfriend moment, a fresh start, maybe even something real. But the day before our meetup, everything shattered. I remember sitting on the condo couch reviewing flashcards when he called me. His breathing was shaky and uneven. At first, I thought he was just stressed. Then I realized he was crying. "Can we talk?" he whispered. Something in me went cold. It took a while for him to choke it out, but when he finally did, the words hit me like a punch straight to the stomach. on the catfish. My heart dropped. He confessed everything. The photos fake. Taken from an Indonesian influencer he'd been pretending to be. His name fake. His work fake. His nationality, he lied about everything. My head was spinning so hard I thought I would throw up. I felt my skin crawl and my face drain of color. It was like he peeled off a mask I didn't even know he was wearing. And then because apparently the universe wanted the moment to be even worse, he sent me a picture of his real face. He claimed he didn't lie about being 24, but honestly, I've seen uncles in their late 30s who looked younger than him. In that moment, my brain connected all the dots. The way he pushed for explicit photos, the way he'd get sulky and aggressive when I refused, the way he'd avoid meeting up. Knowing what he really looked like, what he really was, made all his past behavior 10 times more uncomfortable. When I told him I wanted to break up, he snapped. He said, "So, you're just like the other girls. You only liked me because of the pictures of the guy I used. You never cared about me. You're no different." I was stunned. He lied to me, deceived me, manipulated me. Yet, somehow I became the villain. He ranted and I cried. He blamed me, then he apologized, and then he begged. He guilt tripped like a full cycle of emotional manipulation condensed into 30 minutes. And then came the most unhinged part of it all. He said, "Please, just let me stay with your family on Christmas. I already told my parents, I won't be home. I have nowhere else to go." I stared at my phone in disbelief. Absolutely not. I muted him. I ignored every message, blocked the numbers, refused to let his chaos bleed into my holiday. And I had a peaceful Christmas with my family, the kind of Christmas I needed. But if things had truly ended there, I wouldn't be writing this because Michael didn't stay gone. He didn't accept the breakup. He didn't disappear quietly. And the worst part was still coming. For almost a year, life felt normal again. I focused on myself, my hobbies, and my friends. I became active on Instagram again, something I had stopped doing while dealing with the emotional fallout of Michael's lies. I started posting selfies, little life updates, even some cosplay photos I was proud of. It felt good to exist online without feeling watched. But the one thing I forgot, Michael and I still followed each other. It didn't even cross my mind until it was too late. One night after posting a few stories, nothing dramatic, just a selfie and a behind the scenes of a new cosplay, I got a notification. One message request. Michael. He replied to my story. Hey, how have you been? Just reading his name made something cold crawl up my spine. I didn't open the message. I didn't even breathe for a second. I just locked my phone and tossed it aside like the words would burn me if I looked at them for too long. I tried to ignore it, but the notifications kept coming. Every few hours, another message. Eventually, I got so sick of it, I opened our chat, and the moment I did, my entire body went cold because sitting there sent just minutes earlier, was a photo of the front of our house. My parents weren't home. I felt like the air was being sucked out of my lungs. My fingers moved on instinct. I locked all the doors in the house, ran upstairs, shut my bedroom door, and locked that too. Then I called the police. While I was on the phone trying to speak without my voice cracking, I heard knocking. Pounding. He was outside and yelling my name. He yelled, "Please just open the door. We can talk." His voice was desperate and unhinged, a tone I had never heard before. I held my phone so tightly I thought it might crack. I crouched beside my bed, trying not to make a sound while the dispatcher kept me calm step by step. We're on the way. Don't come out. Stay on the line. It felt like hours, even though it was probably just minutes. Thankfully, we lived close to a police station. I heard footsteps outside, an officer shouting, and then finally silence. They arrested him. When they came to the door to check on me, I finally unlocked it. Still shaking. The officer who talked to me had a serious look on his face. The officer told me he was holding a knife. I had to grip the door frame to stay upright. He came to my house with a knife. I didn't know if he meant to threaten me, hurt me, or hurt himself. But none of the possibilities made me feel any better. They were all terrifying. Because of that, I had no choice but to tell my parents everything. Every lie he told and every red flag I ignored. They scolded me, of course, for trusting someone online and for hiding it from them. But underneath the worry and anger, they were relieved that I was alive. My mom hugged me like I came home from war. Thinking back on the words he was holding a knife still give me the chills.
