STORY 1 — “She Keeps Asking Me to Come With Her”

No one else could see the woman sitting at my mom’s kitchen table.
The first time she asked if I was “ready,” she was sitting at my mom’s kitchen table — and no one else could see her.
That night, I saw her standing outside my bedroom window.
She wasn’t moving. Just smiling. Holding an orange.
After that, oranges started appearing places they shouldn’t. On my desk. In my car. Once, on my pillow. I kept telling myself it was coincidence. Stress. Memory gaps.
Years passed. I moved states. I forgot about her.
Then last week, I was standing in line for coffee when I felt someone watching me. Across the street, she was there. Same smile. Same tilt of her head.
When I crossed over, she was gone.
On the ground where she stood was a crushed, rotting orange.
That night, I checked my mailbox.
Inside was a photo of me in line, taken from behind.
On the back, it said:
“You’re ready now.”


STORY 2 — “Everyone Told Me Not to Turn Around”

Everyone in my town knew the story.
The first time I heard the dragging footsteps behind me, everyone had already warned me not to turn around.
I never believed it.
One night, my friend dared me to walk past the old road where she supposedly died. Nothing happened at first. I was ready to laugh.
Then the insects went silent.
Behind me, I heard it.
Drag.
Click.
Drag.
Click.
A woman started crying softly. She begged me to help her. Said she was hurt.
My friend whispered that she was right behind us now.
The smell of rot hit me before the footsteps did.
My legs locked. My mouth barely worked. I said the words they told us to say — the ones about her mother waiting.
The footsteps stopped.
The crying turned into screaming.
We ran without looking back.
I don’t walk that road anymore.
But sometimes, when I’m lying in bed, I hear the dragging start in the hallway.
And I know she remembers my voice.


STORY 3 — “My Parrot Learned a Sound I Never Made”

I inherited a parrot that could mimic almost anything.
My parrot started mimicking a sound I had never made — heavy breathing, followed by a camera shutter.
I thought she was sick.
The vet told me she was fine. Said parrots repeat what they hear most often.
That’s when I noticed the birds outside copying her.
Click. Click.
It took months to realize what the sound actually was.
One night, while I was on the phone, the clicking stopped. My parrot froze. The bushes outside my porch moved.
Someone stood up from them and ran.
The police never found anything.
But my parrot still makes that breathing sound every morning.
And every night, just before I turn off the lights, I hear:
Click.
Click.
Like someone taking one last picture.


STORY 4 — “My Childhood Friend Was Buried With Someone Else”

When construction workers dug up my missing childhood friend, they found him buried with someone else.
Inside was my friend, buried in someone else’s arms.
The man had no ID. Just a drawing of a man and a boy holding hands.
With my initials next to the boy.
My mother finally told me the truth.
Years earlier, I’d woken up in the woods with no memory of how I got there. She never reported it.
The man had been watching me first.
My friend was taken because I moved away.
They buried him together so they wouldn’t be alone.
Sometimes I think about how close I was to being inside that box instead.
And I wonder if the man ever stopped looking for me.
