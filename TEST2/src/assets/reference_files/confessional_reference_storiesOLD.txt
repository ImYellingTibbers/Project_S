====================
REFERENCE STORY 1
====================

When I was a kid, I used to hear a snapping sound outside my bedroom window at night.
At first, I thought it was just branches. We lived near trees, and the wind would get pretty strong sometimes. I ignored it for years.
Then one night, I realized the sound wasn’t random.
It happened every night at exactly the same time.
I started staying awake to listen for it. The snap would come once, then again a few seconds later. Always two sounds. Never more.
I told my parents, but they said it was probably just the house settling. I wanted to believe them.
The problem was that the sound started getting closer.
It wasn’t outside my window anymore. It was coming from the side of the house. Then from the back door.
I stopped sleeping in my room after that.
Even now, years later, when everything is quiet at night, I still hear it sometimes.
Two snaps.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 2
====================

There was an ice cream truck that used to drive through my neighborhood late at night.
That alone wasn’t strange. We lived near a main road, and sometimes vendors would pass through after events. What was strange was the time.
It always came around midnight.
The first time I heard it, I thought I was imagining things. The music was slow and warped, like the batteries were dying.
I looked outside, but there was no truck.
The next night, it happened again. Same music. Same time.
After a few nights, I realized something else. The sound wasn’t coming from the street.
It was coming from closer. Like it was already inside the neighborhood.
I started checking my phone when it happened. Midnight. Every time.
One night, I finally saw it. Just the back of the truck, parked at the end of the street with its lights off. The music was still playing.
I didn’t go outside.
The next morning, there were tire tracks leading up to my driveway.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 3
====================

I used to walk home from work the same way every night.
It was a quiet route through a residential area. I liked it because nothing ever happened there.
One night, I noticed someone standing near the corner I usually turned at. I assumed they were waiting for someone.
The next night, they were there again.
They never moved. They never waved. They just stood there, facing the street.
After a week, I started taking a different route.
A few days later, I saw them standing at the corner of the new street.
I stopped walking home after that.
Last week, I saw the same figure standing across the street from my apartment building.
They were closer than before.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 4
====================

I was taking the trash out behind my apartment when the security light clicked on, but it lit the alley like it was noon.
I laughed and told myself the bulb must have been replaced, and then I noticed my shadow was facing the wrong way.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 5
====================

I was closing up the gas station on County Road 12 when the bell above the door chimed twice, like someone came in after hours.
I looked up from the register and saw the front door still locked, but the wet boot prints kept appearing across the tile anyway.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 6
====================

I was lying in bed in my parents’ basement when the smoke detector started beeping that slow low-battery chirp, even though I’d changed it that week.
I rolled over to grab my phone and the chirp moved with me, like it was coming from inside my chest.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 7
====================

I was driving home through the canyon at 2 a.m. when my radio cut out and a woman’s whisper started naming every turn before I took it.
I muttered “okay, creepy” and reached to shut it off, but the whisper kept going in the silence, right next to my ear.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 8
====================

I was in the break room at the hospital when the vending machine glass fogged up from the inside, like it was breathing.
I wiped it with my sleeve and saw a palm print appear under the fog, pressing back at me, and it didn’t let go.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 9
====================

I stopped sleeping in my bedroom after the third night.
Not because it was loud, but because it always waited until I lay down.

I sleep on the couch now with the lights on.
Whatever it is still checks the bedroom first.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 10
====================

I don’t shower at night anymore.
The water used to drown out the sound until it started knocking back from inside the walls.

Now I wait until morning, when other people are awake.
I can still hear it sometimes, just not as clearly.

====================
REFERENCE STORY 11
====================

I used to lock my door before bed, but I stopped after it started unlocking itself halfway through the night.
I would wake up to the click and find it open just enough to notice.

Now I sleep with a chair wedged against it.
I don’t think it’s for protection anymore.
