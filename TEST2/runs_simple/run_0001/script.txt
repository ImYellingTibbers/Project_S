[INTRO: Dark ambient music fades in. The camera zooms slowly into the narrator's eyes, shrouded in shadow. His voice is a whisper, yet filled with urgency.]

**Narrator**: (voice trembling) "I didn’t believe in curses until last autumn, the very second I turned the key to my new home... and unleashed something ancient."

[Cut to quick flashes of eerie symbols scratched into the walls, dusty tomes scattered across a floor, and a flickering candle, as the narrator continues.]

**Narrator**: "It started with the whispers... a language I’d never heard, echoing at night from beneath the floorboards, curling up from the very foundation. Each word a chill that gnawed at the marrow of my bones."

[The camera pans to an old, leather journal on a table, pages yellowed with age and scribbled with an undecipherable script.]

**Narrator**: "I found this journal hidden under loose floorboards, pages filled with unimaginable horrors—names of people who once lived there, all vanished, their tales ending abruptly."

[The narrator leans closer to the camera, his eyes wide, haunted.]

**Narrator**: "Every recorded incident... each disappearance... tied to one sinister event— a shadowy gathering that repeats every generation."

[Quick cut to a shot of the narrator staring out a rain-pelted window, the silhouette of an empty street beyond.]

**Narrator**: "Last night, under the blood moon, I saw them. Cloaked figures amassed in my yard, chanting those lost words. The air vibrated, icy tendrils coiling around my heart. 

[The camera shakes slightly, as though the narrator is looking over his shoulder, fear-stricken.]

**Narrator**: "I’m not sure if I’ll be here tomorrow. But if this video reaches you... promise me, never set foot on Hollow Street."

[The screen glitches slightly, then fades to black with the sound of a distant, ghostly wail. Ambient music fades out.]
